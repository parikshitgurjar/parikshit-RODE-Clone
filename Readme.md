> KNOWLEDGE GAINED :

- Firstly, i want to say that this Project "Rode Clone" is my best Project till date.

- In terms of Responsive Design it is Highly Customizable.

- Before this Project i was facing soo many issues regarding Customization properties of Tailwind, and not able to execute the  Configuration files and Packages Properly.

- But as i am creating my previous projects one by one i am getting better and better in it.

- Finally i am able to Setup and able to customise the Tailwind  as i planned and now everything is running Perfectly.

- I am currently working on making these projects much more effecient in terms of Responsiveness and Alignment of Elements and i will keep updating the Code as i am becoming better and better in this.

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
